					<p>“We’re on the brink of something big here, Willow,” Professor Reeves exclaims as he hunches his slim form over the microscope. It’s late and the University lab is only half-lit, eerie blue light casting long shadows over test tube racks and filmy
						petri dishes. Hannah and I share an excited glance before standing up from behind our bank of computers, leaving our data sheets and molecular algorithm behind.</p>
					<p>“Sample M24 - the cells are actually regenerating?” I ask, heart beginning to race. Halfway through the alphabet, thousands of samples later, we’d finally made progress. It was almost too impossible to believe. I rush over to see the microscope to
						see for myself, pushing roughly past Hannah’s small, round shape. For Hannah, the freshman-15 had turned into the freshman-40.</p>
					<p>Professor Reeves steps aside and runs a hand down his scalp, making his graying black hair stand on end like a Albert Einstein. The cells are there, purple-dyed blobs moving, growing, expanding. I nearly shout in joy, before I see the tell-tale sign
						of decay. A dead cell at the top corner of the microscope, burst and leaking fluid like a slowly deflating balloon. No other cells rush to its aid, its own self repair mechanisms revolting on the dying cell as the sample victim’s body rejects the vampyre
						change. Another cells bursts, a line rupturing up its slide as it pulls apart into two useless halves. Then another. And another. Until I realize that M24 is a failure, another cellular suicide, just like all the others before it.</p>
					<p>I sigh audibly, watching the macro-destruction.</p>
					<p>“What? What is it?” Professor Reeves asks and I feel him leaning over me, wanting to push me aside so he can see for himself.</p>
					<p>“The sample is dying. The cellular collapse has just been delayed,” I say, giving the microscope back to him.</p>
					<p>Hannah throws up her arms irritatedly as she stands behind us, short blond hair mushed from sleeping at her desk. I might have let her see the delayed reaction, had she not been slacking on lab hours. It was another late evening for us. She shoots
						me a glare, but doesn’t dare rebuke an upperclassman. But what did she expect - it was my sample solution. All of the M samples were of my own devising, each reaction and cellular death maintained by yours truly. Miss Willow Parker. I slump against
						the table of microscopes. “I am on the brink of something big - a nervous breakdown,” I say sarcastically.</p>
					<p>“The cellular death wasn’t just delayed though,” Professor Reeves says, still hovering over the microscope sample. “The cells actually repaired themselves. That is something, don’t kid yourself. We’ll stick with this solution, run tests, figure out
						why the cells succumbed to the changes.” He recites the same mantra to our research team each time we fail and after 3 years working in the biological engineering lab, I know it by heart.</p>
					<p>Hannah yawns loudly, not trying to hide her tiredness, as she waits for Professor Reeves to give further direction. She’s only worked here a few months and somehow hasn’t realized that Professor Reeves rarely, if ever, gives solid direction for the
						students working under him.</p>
					<p>Professor Reeves removes the sample, looking at the two of us behind a pair of thick black-rimmed glasses. His teenage daughter picked them out and I doubt he knows he looks like an aged hipster, bushy facial hair and all; he even smokes an actual
						wood pipe as he walks between campus buildings. We wouldn’t be doing this research if his daughter hadn’t been marked as a vampyre. I think she is at the point where she will safely complete the change, but with financial backing from the foundation of science and the nobel prize on the line, Professor Reeves couldn’t back out now. If we can find a cure for the change, so that each marked child will complete it successfully and become a full-fledged vampire, we will be sitting
						on a billion dollar empire. Of course, we have to contend with hate mail and death threats from the human public; mainly the religious freaks who found our biological engineering nothing short of satanic. If we were creating a vaccine for ebola,
						I doubt they would be so against our research. At least, not enough to spray paint “Satan Worshippers" on the building and leave a burning bag of dog shit on my porch nearly each week. As one of three vampyre researchers on the team, our actions
						receive more ire from the religious zealots than our human counterparts. We’d taken the risk of going to a human university in order to work with this research, and we understood before starting our 4-years at the University of Washington what
						prejudice we might face. But dog shit, weekly? These people were dedicating hours - no, days of their lives - to collecting animal feces. I have resigned myself to the fact that I will never understand humans.</p>
					<p>“You two should go home,” Professor Reeves says, looking up from the glass in his hands to the two of us. “We actually shouldn’t even be on campus this late. Not while they are still looking into the latest bomb threat to the lab.” He waves us away
						and Hannah takes off happily, grabbing her bag before I even have time to turn off the computer and tidy up my workspace. I’d forced her to work late, as a freshman she was my underling. The others - Andrew, Steven, Olivia - had left hours ago and
						Jens hadn’t even made it to school today. Must have been out late Sunday night, bar hopping and looking for a one-night-stand…again. I never had much of a problem reversing my sleep schedule when I started attending the University, but Olivia and
						Jens always seem to revert to their nocturnal state on the weekends.</p>
					<p>"Make sure to walk in the light,” Professor Reeves calls to me on my way out and I try not to roll my eyes, instead briskly waving at him before heading out to my car in the parking lot. He has a tendency to make the occasional odd, proverbial
						proclamation.</p>
					<p>It’s raining of course, hard and heavy drops contrary to what the weather forecast had predicted. But when is it not raining in Seattle? I thought we’d had rain in Montana where the cold ground and spring rains always seemed to bring about minor
						flooding on the gentle sloping mountains of Helena. But that was nothing in comparison to Seattle. In Seattle, I always have an umbrella on hand and trenchcoats are a key part of my wardrobe. I head towards my vibrant blue Nissan, stopping when I see the car parked three stalls down from mine,
						a large chevy with two male figures in the cab, the truck belching black clouds of smoke and diesel fumes from its rusted exhaust pipe.</p>
					<p><i>Great</i>, I groan inwardly. As a vampyre, I am nothing special. No hidden abilities given to me by Nyx or superior intelligence. Nyx is simply a deity I’ve always been told existed but can’t help but be on the fence about, and my scholarship is the result of stubborn determination. My strength is no more than that of a human woman my own age. The two figures in the truck could overpower me easily, especially if I am caught unaware or attacked with blunt force.</p>
					<p>But they only stare at me, neither getting out of the truck, and so I continue walking to my car. Slower, cautiously, keeping my eye on the dark figures in the chevy. I even think that perhaps I was just being paranoid when I get as far as pulling
						out of the lot and onto a empty street in University District before I notice that they are following me: headlights off, engine purring like an underfed Liger. It’s not long before they are obvious about it, riding my bumper as we near Fremont
						Bridge, and by the way they predict my harried turns, I am guessing that they already know my route home.</p>
					<p>I can’t call anyone. My phone died hours ago in the office and I get too caught up in my work to charge it. I can only speed, windshield wipers going at full capacity, and try to lose them, but first I have to cross the University Bridge to get to Eastlake.
						I know Eastlake better, I can pull in somewhere or run into one of the familiar vampyre bar haunts my research fellows Jens and Olivia drag me to on our occasional night off. The nearest House of Night is on Vashon Island and that’s over an hour away -- not counting the twenty minute ferry that
						won't be running this late. So much for getting help from the High Priestess or a Son of Erebus, and that’s even if they would let me enter the grounds. At 23, I am no longer a fledgling, and I haven’t been to a House of Night since leaving Helena
						at age 18. My random knock on the door would be met with as much skepticism and paranoia as the men following me.</p>
					<p>I should have realized the Chevy had set a trap for me before racing my Nissan up the slick, narrow slope of University Bridge, but I am so certain that my escape lay in the densely populated Eastlake rather than the University District. If
						only it wasn’t a Monday, I think, as the Chevy speeds up to my right side and abruptly rams me into guardrail, metal screaming on metal, my passenger side door crumbling inward like an aluminum can. Before I can try to right myself, they ram again,
						and I think I see the one closest to me laughing through the spiderweb of cracks on driver’s side window, a shadow-faced man with a trucker cap and predatory grin. I hit a puddle going 70 MPH and the car hydroplanes, floating a moment before the steering wheel spins
						uncontrollably in my hands. The Nissan winds in a wide circle like the teacup ride at Disneyland and it doesn’t stop until my first car - bought with cash I had meticulously saved since age twelve, has topped head-first over the medium. The dark water of portage bay rushes toward me, the only thing to break
						the free fall of twisted metal and glass-embedded flesh.
